# 002---Dice-Game
A simple dice game

As the active player, you roll the dice until you roll a 1. Your score will add up every time you roll the dice, however if you roll a 1, your score is deleted and it's the next players turn, meaning you lose all of your points. Of course you can "bank" your score at any time and this will load your points into your "total score" and forfeit your turn. First to 100 wins
